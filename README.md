# autohotkey-config
a script made with autohotkey v2 that changes `caps lock` and `enter` functionality. when held `caps lock` acts as a modifier key that turns `h`,`j`,`k`, and `l` into arrow keys, `o` and `p` into opening and closing braces, etc. when pressed, `caps lock` acts as `esc`. `enter` acts as `ctrl` when held and has its normal functionality when pressed.
